# EAT-N-SPLIT

This is a simple React application which I built to practice working with the useState hook in React. The application helps you to keep track of how you split your bills when you are out with a friend.

- You can add a friend using the 'Add friend button'. You will need to specify a name. If no Image is given, the application picks a random image.

- You can select that friend to open the 'Split Bill' window. Here you can enter the bill amount and how much of the bill you and your friend each are supposed to bear.

- Finally you can select who paid the bill, and then the appication will calculate who owes the other money and by how much.
